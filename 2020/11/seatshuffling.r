# "Seating System"
#
# Challenge:
# This is a cellular automaton problem essentially. Given a "seating chart" with
# floor spaces (.), empty seats (L), and occupied seats (#), deduce the
# arrangement given the input and these rules:
# - "Adjacent" seats are all 8 surrounding a given seat (so, diagonals too)
# - Transformation rules are applied simultaneously
# - If a seat is Empty (L) without occupied seats (#) adjacent, it fills (#)
# - If a seat is Occupied (#) and 4+ adj are also occupied (#), it empties (L)
# - Otherwise, state does not change.
# - Flooring is always just a floor.
#
# Here are the iterations of the sample chart:
#
# L.LL.LL.LL   #.##.##.##   #.LL.L#.##   #.##.L#.##   #.#L.L#.##   #.#L.L#.##
# LLLLLLL.LL   #######.##   #LLLLLL.L#   #L###LL.L#   #LLL#LL.L#   #LLL#LL.L#
# L.L.L..L..   #.#.#..#..   L.L.L..L..   L.#.#..#..   L.L.L..#..   L.#.L..#..
# LLLL.LL.LL   ####.##.##   #LLL.LL.L#   #L##.##.L#   #LLL.##.L#   #L##.##.L#
# L.LL.LL.LL   #.##.##.##   #.LL.LL.LL   #.##.LL.LL   #.LL.LL.LL   #.#L.LL.LL
# L.LLLLL.LL   #.#####.##   #.LLLL#.##   #.###L#.##   #.LL#L#.##   #.#L#L#.##
# ..L.L.....   ..#.#.....   ..L.L.....   ..#.#.....   ..L.L.....   ..L.L.....
# LLLLLLLLLL   ##########   #LLLLLLLL#   #L######L#   #L#LLLL#L#   #L#L##L#L#
# L.LLLLLL.L   #.######.#   #.LLLLLL.L   #.LL###L.L   #.LLLLLL.L   #.LLLLLL.L
# L.LLLLL.LL   #.#####.##   #.#LLLL.##   #.#L###.##   #.#L#L#.##   #.#L#L#.##
#
# After repeated application of these rules, the seating distribution
# stabilizes. Report how many seats are occupied at that point.
