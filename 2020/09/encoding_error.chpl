  "Encoding Error"

  Challenge:
  Given a list of numbers, treating the first 25 (5 for the sample) as a
  "preamble," every subsequent number SHOULD BE the sum of at least one pair of
  different numbers from the preceding 25 (5). Find the first number from the
  list that is not the sum of two different numbers in the set before it.
