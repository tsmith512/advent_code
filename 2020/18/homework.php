"Operation Order"

Challenge:
Help a kid do his math homework. They broke PMDAS. Execute parentheses first,
then all remaining operations left-to-right.

Example:
1 + (2 * 3) + (4 * (5 + 6))
1 +      6  + (4 * (5 + 6))
         7  + (4 * (5 + 6))
         7  + (4 *     11)
         7  +          44
                       51

Resolve each line in the input and report the sum.
