# Advent of Code

Showing my progress through [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020). As
a product manager, my primary work is not writing code. And some of what I know
well is a bit dated. So I've decided to lean into my experience with traditional
"Advent Calendars" which end up being more like samplers of many things.
