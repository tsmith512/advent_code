# Advent of Code

## 2021

Giving this another go because I had so much fun last year, even if I didn't
make it to the end. Not committing to the "language of the day" approach, but
we'll see.

## 2020

Showing my progress through [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020). As
a product manager, my primary work is not writing code. And some of what I know
well is a bit dated. So I've decided to lean into my experience with traditional
"Advent Calendars" which end up being more like samplers of many things.

_Take this with a grain of salt:_ I comment heavily, and some problems are
easier than others. Also I started most of these days with a Hello World so I
may be missing some idiomatic methods or efficiencies. But I still thought it
was fun.
